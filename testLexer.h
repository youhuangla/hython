/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.4
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : test.g
 *     -                            On : 2023-10-03 18:50:28
 *     -                 for the lexer : testLexerLexer
 *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise.
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The lexer 
testLexer

has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 *
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef ptestLexer, which is returned from a call to testLexerNew().
 *
 * As this is a generated lexer, it is unlikely you will call it 'manually'. However
 * the methods are provided anyway.
 *
 * The methods in ptestLexer are  as follows:
 *
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->T__12(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->T__13(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->PLUS(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->MINUS(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->TIMES(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->ASSIGN(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->ID(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->INT(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->NEWLINE(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->WS(ptestLexer)
 *  - 
 void
      ptestLexer->Tokens(ptestLexer)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
